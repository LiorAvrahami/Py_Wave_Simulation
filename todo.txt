support nd problems. not much change is needed in the code.
smooth out velocity
Furier transform
implement pause
f(t) - boundary conditions
flow out boundary conditions
point viscosity
joint that allows only tension to pass and not (so angle will pass but the point won't move)
joint that allows point to move up and down freely, but doesn't allow a tangent at that point
