smooth out velocity
Furier transform
control time flow - until this is done c is without meaning
implement pause
f(t) - boundery conditions
flow out boundery conditions
point viscosity
joint that allows only tension to pass and not (so angle will pass but the point won't move)
joint that allows point to movve up and down freely, but doesn't allow a tangent at that point
